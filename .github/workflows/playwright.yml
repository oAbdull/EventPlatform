      # (API Gateway, services, databases, etc.) is running and accessible
      # at the baseURL configured in playwright.config.ts (e.g., http://localhost:8080).
      # In a real CI/CD pipeline, you would typically have preceding steps
      # to build Docker images, deploy the application (e.g., using docker-compose),
      # and wait for it to be ready before running these E2E tests.
